## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior at Washington University in St. Louis obtaining a bachelor's degree in systems engineering and a minor in computer science. After I graduate in December, I will pursue a master's degree in Engineering Data Analytics and Statistics from WashU. I am interested in analyzing and modeling complex systems in order to automate technological functions. I am fluent in multiple computer programming languages and have over three years of experience using modeling software. I enjoy learning new skills and being challenged through complex problem-solving. On this page, you can view some of the projects I have completed or am working on.

Programming languages and tools: Python, MATLAB, JAVA, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, R, PowerShell, Git, GitHub, Splunk, Jenkins, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Keras, Microsoft 365, Power BI
