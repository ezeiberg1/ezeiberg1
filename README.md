About

I am a senior at Washington University in St. Louis pursuing a bachelors degree in systems engineering and a minor in computer science. After I graduate in December, I plan to get a master's in Engineering Data Analytics and Statistics from WashU. I am interested in analyzing and modeling complex systems in order to automate technology functions. I am fluent in multiple computer programming languages and have three years of experience using modeling software. I enjoy learning new skills and being challenged through complex problem-solving.

Programming languages and tools: Python, MATLAB, JAVA, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, R, PowerShell, Git, GitHub, Splunk, Jenkins, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Microsoft 365
